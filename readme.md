Larabook
========

A work-along repository to go with Laracasts' "[Let's Build Larabook From Scratch](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-from-scratch)" series.

Live demo available at http://voidteamdev.net

**Lesson 1:** Basically covered just setting up homestead, although not quite relevant to this repo.

**Lesson 2:** Added some dependencies including generators, codeception, and a couple laracasts-specific packages.

**Lesson 3:** This just showcases how to use environment variables to protect sensitive database information and hook up to Sequel Pro, which I have done before the lessons even started.

**Lesson 4:** Added our "Master Page" and pulled in Bootstrap for design. Also created a simple PagesController for our simple static pages.

**Lesson 5:** Basic Homepage design with Bootstrap boilerplate code, prepared for SASS install.

**Lesson 6:** Install Gulp and set up some basic tasks for automatically watching and compiling scss files.

**Lesson 7:** We setup some unit tests with Codeception and fake registration functionality.

**Lesson 8:** Extremely basic user registration and authentication.

**Lesson 9:** Registration Validation and some nicer styling.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
